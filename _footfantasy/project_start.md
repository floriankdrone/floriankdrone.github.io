# The Idea
My friend and I are big fans of football in general and also fantasy football. We want to do create a fantasy football game.
# The stack
## Backend
As I am starting to learn RoR. I want to use this stack as my backend stack.
## Frontend
For the frontend, we will use ReactJS for development to be easier on different platforms.
# The process
From my understanding of Ruby on Rails, this language makes creating app very fast however there is a need to have done lot of pre work. We really need to think about the different models to create and the relationships between them.
